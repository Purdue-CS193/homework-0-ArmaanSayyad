# Welcome to Armaan's CS 193 Homework 1

#### Some of my Favorite things about CS 193:
- Workload: Whilst being a useful and informative class, it maintains a mangable workload to an extent that it is enjoyable and yet no tedious!
- Location: University Church 114 is one of, if not the best lecture hall I attend any of my classes in. Although not ergonomically conveniant from a visual standpoint, it is a beautiful room.
- Faculty: Being a student run class ensures that the information provided is relevant, recently expereienced based and in a format that will make it enjoyable to do!
